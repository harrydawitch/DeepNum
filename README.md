# **DeepNum**
In this repository, I build deep learning concepts from the ground up using only standard libraries. I find this process both enjoyable and invaluable for building a strong intuition about each concept.

This repository contains implementations of core deep learning concepts built from scratch using only standard libraries like NumPy. Each module covers fundamental principles, from neural network basics to advanced architectures.
